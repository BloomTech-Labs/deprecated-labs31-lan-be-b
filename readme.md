### To do
- user track put endpoint
- career coach token validation middleware

### Notes
- structure of tables?
- upvote functionality, updating in real time?, how it works on the back end, will have only upvotes and no downvotes
- career coach role, special code on sign in?, checkbox on form?
- recommended questions, random question, search, filter by cohort, trending/popular, order by recent by default
- have to set to local state in order to update real time, once refresh page, all data will sync
- urls with usernames and post questions instead of ids?
- can view questions without logging in, but once try to post question, prompted to sign up/sign in?

### Stretch  
- reply to reply functionality
- @ functionality
